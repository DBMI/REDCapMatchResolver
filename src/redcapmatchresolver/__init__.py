REDCap Match Resolver

This application assists with human expert review of possible patient matches.
When software identifies a pair of patient records that >might< refer to the
same patient, the REDCap Report Writer class writes human-readable,
machine-parseable reports showing potential patient matches that need review by human.
Once the reviewer has reviewed the patient info and have marked up the reports
 with their decisions, the REDCapReportReader class
reads/parses the marked-up reports, producing a pandas DataFrame output.

Classes:
    REDCap Appointment
    REDCap Match Resolver
    REDCap Patient
    REDCap Report Reader
    REDCap Report Writer
